Introduction
============

GNU Robots is a game/diversion where you construct a program for a
little robot, then set him loose and watch him explore a world on his
own.  The robot program is written in Scheme, and is implemented using
GNU Guile.

Installing GNU Robots
======================

(0) To build GNU Robots, you *first* need to have already compiled and
    installed the GNU Guile library.  GNU Robots was built using Guile 2.0.

(1) Type:

    ./configure

    To specify an unusual location for GNU Guile, you can use the
    `--with-guile=' option, like this:

    ./configure --with-guile=/home/user

(2) Look at the generated `Makefile', and check that everything is
    okay.  Then type:

    make

Notes
=====

* There is really one key missing piece in GNU Robots: I had
* originally envisioned a "visual" programming interface for GNU
* Robots, one where you could create a robot program by dropping into
* place icons that represent the robot's actions.  There would be one
* icon to tell the robot to move forward, another to have him turn to
* the left or right, and another to have him pick up things or fire
* his little gun.
*
* This programming interface would really just act as a kind of code
* generator; it would write a Scheme program that you could then load
* into GNU Robots.
*
* This will hopefully be in the next release!


To run GNU Robots, run "gnurobots"

--

The sample map that is provided as "maps/small.map" is just a single
room, with prizes all along the four walls.  The sample robot program
"scheme/simple.scm" knows how to pick up all these prizes and then
quit.  Other map files can be found in the maps/ directory, and other
robot programs are in the scheme/ directory.

The usage for gnurobots is as follows:

  gnurobots [OPTION]... [FILE]

Options are:

    -f, --map-file=FILE    Load map file
    -s, --shields=N        Set initial shields to N
    -e, --energy=N         Set initial energy to N
    -V, --version          Output version information and exit
    -h, --help             Display this help and exit

    Note: FILE refers to a scheme file and ./bin/gnurobots enters into
          interactive mode if it is not specified.
